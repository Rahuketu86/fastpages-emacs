# Introduction

This repository is for a dedicated fastpages-emacs image which will be used for fastpages. There are multiple reasons we want to have a dedicated image

1. Emacs 26.3 - Even though default version works pretty well for default org-html export. It is not ideal if you want to use latest and greatest emacs org mode changes and packages like org-re-reveal which depend on it.

2. Installation of emacs 26.x on docker container for fastpages-dev which is based on ubuntu 16.04 is painful

3. I want to scratch an itch . Also want to come up with a setup which lets me modify fastpages without making changes in core code.
